## **Conceptual idea on basic of scrum and agile project management.**

1. **Agile Project Management:**
Agile is used to deliver software project on time in working condition and fully tested. It is more focused on strengths and efficiency of the team. It is highly recommended by the client because in agile method if he wants to change any feature of software then he can do it by telling the developer. In this internal feedback, client and different department review are considered to maintain work efficiency and solve any issues.

2. **Scrum Project Management:**
Scrum is a part of agile but it is more flexible and mostly used because teams are broken down into small groups with the goal that they have to deliver on time and it has more successful rate. It is modern way of agile to do work with flexibility and showcase the software regularly. Meetings play an important role and demos take place to follow progress and gather feedback.

## **Explain Sprint?**
A Sprint help the team and developers to work more efficiently and faster to deliver the project. Sprints are used in Agile and Scrum project management more often because the groups and goals are broken down to solve issues with flexibility. 

## **Write one or two feature's user stories for the "Tinder app" using the key points? You can select any module and can write user stories for that.**

This is not just a review but also my love story. I installed tinder last year near June and never took it seriously, I used to just swipe and look at profiles of beautiful girls, marked like on all of them and got few good responses also but nothing serious happened. Then one day one girl replied and now she is love of my life.

The concept is very good, it takes information from Facebook and displays on the profile and you can view the profiles and mark like, superlike or dislike on the profile, if the other party also places like on your profile then you can start chatting, after that it's all your talent.

The design is very good, you just have to swipe on the profiles to place your view. The layout is such that the whole screen will show the DP and and small icon of like, superlike and dislike on the bottom, if you want to see other pictures then you just have to tap on the dp.

The features and functions I already have explained, it is basically a dating app which will show profiles in your city in the free version and if you have pro version then you can see profiles from other cities also.

This app is very useful and I met my love here only. But one advice to guys is give respect to girls to get respect, don't use this app to get one night stand and girls please beware of such guys.

**2.** This review was given by **Kathuria** from **Delhi,India**.
I have used tinder in the past just to know what it is about and what my verdict is that it is a app which creates matches only based on looks , there are about 100 guys for 1 girl on these online dating apps. So the choice is obvious, you have to be good looking to succeed on an app like this. I have had some matches on the app when I was using it but it's just a useless app which does not assure you how the person might look or their personality. It's just a picture and nowadays photoshop is used almost in every person's pictures.

Tinder was made for random people to meet and interact or connect. But it can not be successful in India for a reason which doesn't need to be explained. Also tinder is just an app, they do need money too so they only give a few likes free in a day and then give a pop up and suggest you to buy unlimited likes for a monthly or annually package. It's a good idea to earn lots of bucks , who ever designed it and thought about knew what people will easily fall for and can earn them easy money overnight.

Overall, if your looking for a date don't use this app , it's not a right way to find someone and date them . Even if you do it won't last trust me.
